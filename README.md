# Minotor Open Source

Minotor is an open source software for data and machine learning models monitoring. 

Data inconsistency, drift and bias are responsible for most of the model failures in the real world. Minotor helps you solve that problem by tracking inconsistency between your training and production data, detecting bias in your model and performance drops. 

Minotor has been built to be easy to handle. Download our Python package, plug your model through a decorator, and you are ready to go !
